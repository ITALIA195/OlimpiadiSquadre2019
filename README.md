# Olympics in Team

This repository contains my take on the exercises of the 11th edition of the [Olympics in Team](https://sites.google.com/aldini.istruzioneer.it/olimpiadi-informatica-squadre/homepage) project.

## Solutions

Keep in mind that this repository doesn't contain any of the solutions I submitted. I tried solving the exercises after the competions in order to prepare myself to the upcoming rounds, hence I had access to both the internet and the solutions (even though I avoided using either on the exercises I knew I could solve)
